{"name":"The Tornado Project","tagline":"R-based open source analysis of Tornado data","body":"Goal\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this project is to bring consistency and transparency to the analyses of publicly available Tornado datasets using an R-based open source analysis. The initial focus is on probabilistic and stochastic analysis of the tornado hazard towards risk modeling.\r\n\r\nTornado data available from the NOAA [Storm Prediction Center](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/gis/svrgis/) and other government agencies around the world has been the focus of many studies (e.g., [References](https://github.com/RationShop/tornado_r/wiki/References)). However, there are a number of issues with these studies:\r\n\r\nIssues\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* The data itself is changing - both in quantity (additional data added every season) and quality (quality control measures appear to have been applied in the recent past, particularly to the data prior to the 1990s). Hence, it is not possible to exactly, or sometimes even approximately, reproduce the results of these studies. Since the data size is annually changing, it makes more sense to have the analyses revised annually as well. \r\n* With the exception of a few (thanks to R user Prof. James Elsner and colleagues), none of the studies provide the code used in their analysis. Moreover, one of the recent studies (Simmons et al 2013) appears to have several errors.\r\n* Data prior to 1950 in the United States appears to be available only on microfilm. Hopefully, through or due to this effort, some day this data becomes more widely available.\r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n1. Create an R package \r\n * The package would come with raw and cleaned Tornado data\r\n2. Functionality provided by the R package would include:\r\n * reproduction/replication of summary statistics presented by literature studies. \r\n * adjustment of historical monetary losses for inflation and other factors, based on literature.\r\n * creation of stochastic and probabilistic models of Tornado hazard, based on literature.\r\n3. Extend the above to Tornado data from other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* Replicated stats from four [Tornado literature](https://github.com/RationShop/tornado_r/wiki/References) sources - see [counting analysis](https://github.com/RationShop/tornado_r/wiki/Counting-Tornadoes) and [individual sources](https://github.com/RationShop/tornado_r/wiki/_pages)\r\n\r\nImmediate Next Steps\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* Replicate the analysis of Brooks et al (2003)\r\n","google":"UA-4234074-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
