<a name="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to bring consistency and transparency to the analyses of publicly available Tornado data using an R-based analysis. The initial focus is on probabilistic and stochastic analysis of the tornado hazard towards risk modeling.</p>

<h2>
<a name="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h2>

<p>Tornado data available from the NOAA <a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/gis/svrgis/">Storm Prediction Center</a> and other government agencies around the world has been the focus of many studies (e.g., see <a href="https://github.com/RationShop/tornado_r/wiki/References">select literature</a>). However, there are a number of issues with the state of the scientific literature and the culture of publishing only the end result of a scientific analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li>The data itself is changing - both in quantity (additional data added every season) and quality (quality control measures appear to have been applied in the recent past, particularly to the data prior to the 1990s). Hence, it is not possible to exactly, or sometimes even approximately, reproduce the results of these studies. Since the data size is annually changing, it makes more sense to have the analyses revised annually as well. </li>
<li>With the exception of a few (thanks to R user Prof. James Elsner and colleagues), none of the studies provide the code used in their analysis. </li>
<li>During the course of this project several literature studies were found to have errors; sometimes, such errors were found to seriously question the entire study.</li>
<li>Data prior to 1950 in the United States appears to be available only on microfilm. Hopefully, through or due to this effort, some day this data becomes more widely available.</li>
